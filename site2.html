        <p>Located in a former Methodist church, the Town of Oswego Historical 
            Society and Museum has many artifacts of Dr. Mary Walker such as photos 
            and letters, and many of her family's items, including her father’s 
            journal, mother’s portrait and sisters’ letters. Other interesting artifacts 
            include her invitation to President Ulysses S. Grant's first inaugural ball, where she 
            sat with Generals Thomas and Sherman, a bible that she purchased from the Lacy mansion in 
            Virginia when she was serving in the hospital there and a medal given posthumously by the 
            National Women’s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, NY. Although Mary was never associated with 
            any particular church, she would have visited here, and the minister of this church officiated 
            at her funeral. Open by appointment by calling the Town Historian George DeMass. See the Town 
            of Oswego website for more information.
