        <p>Oswego is very proud of its hometown hero, and this mural near the main 
          corner of downtown was part of an initiative in 1999 to beautify the city with art celebrating our history.  In a campaign sponsored by the Oswego Historic Mural Society, this full-size image was the fifth commissioned. The artist was Ellen Klem, a graduate student in art at SUNY Oswego.
          Riversend Books is a family owned independent bookstore that has books on Dr Mary Walker and local history.
