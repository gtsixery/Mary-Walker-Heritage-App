        <p>Fort Ontario was significant in the Civil War as a recruitment center for 
          soldiers and Oswego County sent a disproportionately high number of recruits 
          to the Union army. Dr. Mary Walker was only associated with the Fort in her 
          later years. The 1906 photograph of Dr. Walker standing under an umbrella 
          was taken on the road in front of Officers Row, a line of brick buildings no
          longer there, which was near the current road between the main and overlook
          parking lots. The occasion was the July 4th Independence Day Parade which 
          also celebrated the reopening of Fort Ontario after a huge construction and
          modernization project. In the background is the main ballfield and houses 
          along East 9th Street. She was later treated at the Fort Ontario Army 
          Hospital #5 in the summer of 1918 after she suffered from a "stroke of 
          paralysis". The Fort Ontario newspaper, the Ontario Chronicles, reported 
          her death in February 1919, saying, "The career of the woman physician, 
          one of the first in the history of the country, was picturesque and brimful. 
          She was the first woman to hold a commission as assistant army surgeon, 
          having served in that capacity in the Civil War. Dr. Walker considered it the greatest personal compliment to be mistaken for a man. Her death will be gravely felt within the ranks of feminism, a cause which she did much to further through her long life."
